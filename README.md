# Automate Day Job with Python

## Background

Using Python to complete two Python activities, PyBank and PyRamen. Both activities present a real-world situation in which the Python skills will come in handy. 

## PyBank

In this activity, creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the company. The financial dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. 

The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## PyRamen 

To analyze the business's financial performance by cross-referencing the sales data with the internal menu data to figure out revenues and costs for the year.

Also to analyze how well the business did on a per-product basis (as there are several choices of ramen) in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly, and, ultimately, which products may need to be removed or changed.

Python provides a wide range of capabilities for handling data, harnessing the power of low-level Python data structures and high-level development libraries, all the while supporting the automation and scalability needs for a growing enterprise.
